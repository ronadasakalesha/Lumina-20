# ✨ Lumina 20 Strategy

**"When in doubt, stick to the light."**

## 🌟 Philosophy
**Lumina 20** is a momentum-based trading strategy designed to catch explosive moves in the market with **clarity** and **precision**.

It uses the **20 EMA (Exponential Moving Average)** as its "Guiding Light":
-   **Above the Light**: Bullish Territory. Look for strength.
-   **Below the Light**: Bearish Territory. Look for weakness.

The strategy waits for a decisive **Breakout** (crossing the light) and a strong **Confirmation** before entering, ensuring we only trade when the momentum is real.

## 🎯 Core Rules

### 1. The Light (20 EMA)
The foundation of the strategy. It acts as dynamic support/resistance and trend filter.

### 2. The Setup
-   **Buy Signal**: A Green Candle **crosses up** through the 20 EMA (Open < EMA < Close).
    -   *Confirmation*: A Red Candle follows shortly, holding **above** the EMA.
-   **Sell Signal**: A Red Candle **crosses down** through the 20 EMA (Open > EMA > Close).
    -   *Confirmation*: A Green Candle follows shortly, holding **below** the EMA.

### 3. The Trigger
We mark the High (for Buy) or Low (for Sell) of the confirmation candle.
-   **Entry**: INSTANTLY enter when price breaks this level.

### 4. Risk Management (1:4 RRR)
-   **Stop Loss (SL)**: Tight protection at the setup candle's Low (Buy) or High (Sell).
-   **Take Profit (TP)**: Aim for **4x** the risk. Catch the big run.
